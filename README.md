## Hi there 👋 I'm Anirudh

### About Me
I'm a passionate developer who enjoys working on various projects, from full-stack web applications to game development. I love learning new technologies and applying them to create innovative solutions. This is my personal GitHub repository where I showcase the projects I'm currently working on

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **CLI AI Tool** that helps developers automate tasks using natural language processing.
- 🌱 I’m exploring serverless architecture with **HTMX, Hono, and Supabase** to build scalable and efficient full-stack applications.
- 🎮 I'm developing a **JS LF2 Browser Multiplayer Game**, a simple clone of the classic game Little Fighter 2, bringing it to the web with basic multiplayer capabilities.
- 📦 Working on an **Xbox Auto Downloader and Cloud Backup** tool that simplifies game media management by automating downloads and syncing with cloud storage.
