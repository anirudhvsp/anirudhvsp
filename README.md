## Hi there 👋 I'm Anirudh

### About Me
I'm a passionate developer who enjoys working on various projects, from full-stack web applications to game development. I love learning new technologies and applying them to create innovative solutions. This is my personal GitHub repository where I showcase the projects I'm currently working on

- 🔭 Working on an **Xbox Auto Downloader and Cloud Backup** tool that simplifies game media management by automating downloads and syncing with cloud storage. This kinda went off the rails and now this is a full fledged streaming solution with adaptive bitrate streaming using HLS and also a tiktok like short video mode utilizing htmx for dynamic content loading, currently hosted on AWS accessible at  : (https://streamitnow.site/home)
- 🌱 I’m exploring serverless architecture with **HTMX, Hono, and Supabase** to build scalable and efficient full-stack applications.
- 🎮 I'm developing a **JS LF2 Browser Multiplayer Game**, a simple clone of the classic game Little Fighter 2, bringing it to the web with basic multiplayer capabilities.
